# 3D Bounce Game

Welcome to the 3D Bounce Game project! This is a basic 3D version of the classic Bounce game, developed as a college project. It's implemented using C++ and the CGraphics library.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The main objective of this project was to recreate the classic Bounce game in a 3D environment. The game involves controlling a ball that bounces off platforms, with the goal of navigating through the game while avoiding obstacles.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **C++**: The game logic and mechanics are implemented using C++, a powerful and versatile programming language.
- **CGraphics**: The CGraphics library is used for rendering the 3D graphics in the game.

## 🎮 Game Features

- **Play, Pause, and Start**: Control the flow of the game with play, pause, and start features.
- **High Score**: Keep track of your highest score.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when you run out of lives or hit an obstacle.
- **Lives**: Keep track of the number of lives left in the game.

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Game

To run the game, you need to have a C++ compiler and the CGraphics library installed on your system. Once you have these prerequisites, you can compile and run the game using your C++ compiler.

## 📝 Note

This project is a basic implementation of the 3D Bounce game. There's plenty of scope for adding more features and improving the game mechanics. Feel free to fork this repository and make your own enhancements!

Thank you for visiting this repository. Enjoy the game!
